# Working with videos
In this challenge we're going to Automated Video Processing with Moviepy, and we will start by creating thumbnail

## MoviePy
MoviePy is a Python module for video editing, which can be used for basic operations (like cuts, concatenations, title insertions), video compositing (a.k.a. non-linear editing), video processing, or to create advanced effects. It can read and write the most common video formats, including GIF.

MoviePy is suppercharged with two other packages :
    - [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) 
        > ImageMagick is free software delivered as a ready-to-run binary distribution or as source code that you may use, copy, modify, and distribute in both open and proprietary applications
    - [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/)
        > FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to **decode, encode, transcode, mux, demux, stream, filter and play** pretty much anything that humans and machines have created

We used the python module [pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) to turn the frame data to an actual image

`pipenv install Pillow`
